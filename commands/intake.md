description: Scan all Linear teams for Todo issues assigned to the user and process each one through the full Pathfinder pipeline.
---

# /intake

Usage: `/intake`

## What it does
1. Fetches all Todo issues assigned to you via `linear.sh my-todos`
2. Filters out already-processed issues (checks `memory/processed-issues.json`)
3. For each unprocessed issue, runs the full pipeline:
   - Classify (bug/feature)
   - Generate RCA or TRD
   - Identify code changes
   - Assemble plan
   - Generate subtasks (if complexity >= M multi-repo, L, or XL)
   - Post plan + subtasks to Linear via `linear.sh comment <ID> "plan content"`
   - Transition to In Progress via `linear.sh status <ID> progress`
4. Reports summary of processed issues

## Example
```
